**Oracle-On-Kunernetes** is a collection of example Kubernetes Manifest files utilising the Pure Service Orchestrator (PSO) Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver to provide persistent Block or File (NFS) storage to Oracle Databases containers.


## Kubernetes Environment
**Oracle-on-Kubernets** has been tested on MicroK8s but should also work with other Kubernetes distributions.


## Oracle Database Features
1. Create Oracle 12c, 18c 18c(XE), 19c Database
1. Stop / Start Databases
1. Relocate / Move Databases

## Getting Started

1. Create a Kubernetes Cluster using preffered distribution e.g MicroK8s
1. Download required Oracle Database ZIP files from OTN, a valid OTN account and licences will be requrired.
